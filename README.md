# MIPS-simulation-computer-architecture
Implement a new micro-controller architecture simulator similar to MIPS using Java. The program take the instructions that will be executed. The code print all the pipeline registers in every cycle of the data path of the instructions passing throw all the stages (Fetch, Decode, Execution, Memory and write back) stages.
